              <h2 class="title-sections">Origins and Particularity of SARS-CoV2</h2>
                <p>The origins of the virus are still unknown. Recent studies revealed that for sure is not a product of genetic engineering, despite the recent complottist theories.
                  Josie Golding, PhD, epidemics lead at UK-based Wellcome Trust, said the findings by Andersen and his colleagues are "crucially important to bring an evidence-based view to the rumors that have been circulating about the origins of the virus (SARS-CoV-2) causing COVID-19."
                  "They conclude that the virus is the product of natural evolution," Goulding adds, "ending any speculation about deliberate genetic engineering."

                <p>Based on their genomic sequencing analysis, Andersen and his collaborators concluded that the most likely origins for SARS-CoV-2 followed one of two possible scenarios.
                  In one scenario, the virus evolved to its current pathogenic state through natural selection in a non-human host and then jumped to humans.
                  This is how previous coronavirus outbreaks have emerged, with humans contracting the virus after direct exposure to civets (SARS) and camels (MERS).
                  The researchers proposed bats as the most likely reservoir for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_coronavirus_2" target="_blank" title="wikipedia-SARS-CoV-2-page">SARS-CoV-2</a> as it is very similar to a bat coronavirus. <br>
                  There are no documented cases of direct bat-human transmission, however, suggesting that an intermediate host was likely involved between bats and humans.

              <div class="corona-symptoms-list">
                <p>Reported illnesses have ranged from people with mild symptoms to people being severely ill and dying.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Fever</strong></li>
                  <li><strong>Cough</strong></li>

                <p>"COVID-19 typically causes flu-like symptoms including a fever and cough.
                  In some patients - particularly the elderly and others with other chronic health conditions - these symptoms can develop into pneumonia, with chest tightness, chest pain, and shortness of breath.
                  It seems to start with a fever, followed by a dry cough. After a week, it can lead to shortness of breath, with about 20% of patients requiring hospital treatment.
                  Notably, the COVID-19 infection rarely seems to cause a runny nose, sneezing, or sore throat (these symptoms have been observed in only about 5% of patients). Sore throat, sneezing, and stuffy nose are most often signs of a cold."

              <h3>European Situation</h3>
                <p>European states are facing the biggest crisis since the World War II. Italy results the most affected country in Europe as per today's <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/" target="_blank" title="worldometer-covid19-statistics">worldometer statistics</a> counting 53.578 infected and 4.825 deaths regitered. The government has decided to lock downs all the industries and activities that are not essential for the for the survival of the Italians as basic necessities.
                  The army is deployed on the streets and the Italians are living it as a war against an invisible enemy. Europe looks somewhere else giving Italy almost 0 help as is doing with other European nations. </p>

True to form, it will respond to the COVID-19 crisis with heroic announcements heralding impressive numbers that disguise the irrelevance and timidity of the agreed policies.</cite>"
